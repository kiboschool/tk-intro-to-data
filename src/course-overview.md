<!-- Data analysis requires acquiring and cleaning data from various sources including the web, APIs, and databases. Students learn techniques for summarizing and exploring data with tools like spreadsheets, jupyter notebook, and Python. They also learn to create data visualizations, and practice communication with data. Finally, students are introduced to machine learning techniques of prediction and classification, which will prepare them for advanced study of data science.

Throughout the course, students will work with real datasets and attempt to answer questions relevant to real-life problems.

### Course Objectives
At the end of the course, student will
- Understand the basics of data science, its relevance in the current business environment and its applications in solving real-world problems.
- Learn various data collection and cleaning techniques, and tools.
- Learn how to visualize and analyze data to generate insights that drive business decisions.
- Understand the basic concepts of machine learning and how to apply them to real-world problems.

## What you'll learn

Data science is applicable to a myriad of professions, and analyzing large amounts of data is a common application of computer science. This course empowers students to analyze data, and produce data-driven insights. It covers the foundational suite of concepts needed to solve data problems, including preparation (collection and processing), presentation (information visualization), and analysis (machine learning).

## Course Overview

* Week 1: Intro to Data Science
* Week 2: Databases and SQL
* Week 3: Data Visualization and Insight
* Week 4: Intro to Machine Learning
* Week 5: Final Project and Wrap up

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this class:

* Read and engage with the materials on this site
* Attend live class and complete the activities in class
* Practice with exercises to try out the concepts
* Complete projects to demonstrate what you have learned

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice outside of the practice problems included in the course. You should also try building various programs so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of ways.
