## Intro to ML Practice Exercises

### Part 1: Classification

You are given a dataset containing information about students' exam scores and whether they passed or failed the final exam. Your task is to build a classification model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their exam scores.

**Dataset: Student Performance**

| Exam 1 Score | Exam 2 Score | Passed |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| 65           | 75           | 1      |
| 80           | 62           | 0      |
| 55           | 45           | 0      |
| 45           | 78           | 0      |
| 70           | 90           | 1      |
| ...          | ...          | ...    |

**Questions:**

1. What is the target variable in this dataset?
   - Exam 1 Score
   - Exam 2 Score
   - Passed
2. Which type of machine learning problem is this?
   - Clustering
   - Regression
   - Classification
3. What is the purpose of the classification model in this scenario?
4. Choose the correct statement:
   - Classification predicts numerical values.
   - Classification predicts categorical outcomes.
   - Classification predicts time series data.


### Part 2: Regression

You are given a dataset containing information about houses, including their sizes (in square feet) and corresponding prices. Your task is to build a regression model to predict the price of a house based on its size.

**Dataset: House Prices**

| Size (sq ft) | Price ($) |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1500         | 200000    |
| 1800         | 230000    |
| 1200         | 150000    |
| 2200         | 250000    |
| 1600         | 210000    |
| ...          | ...       |

**Questions:**

1. What is the target variable in this regression dataset?
   - Size (sq ft)
   - Price ($)
2. Which type of machine learning problem is this?
   - Clustering
   - Classification
   - Regression
3. What is the purpose of the regression model in this scenario?
4. Choose the correct statement:
   - Regression predicts numerical values.
   - Regression predicts categorical outcomes.
   - Regression predicts time series data.


<!-- ## Submission
You are required to submit documentation for practice exercises over the course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 2% of your overall grade.

- Practice exercises will be graded for completion not perfect correctness. 
- You have to document that you did the work, but we **won't** be checking if you got it right.
- You **MUST** upload your analysis/visuals as a single file to `Practices - ML` on **Gradescope** after the exercise to get the grade for this exercise.


Your log will count for credit as long as:
- It is accessible to your instructor, and
- It shows your own work.
