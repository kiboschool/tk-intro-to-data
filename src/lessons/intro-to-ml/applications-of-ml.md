## Applications of ML
ML is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. As machine learning technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of machine learning in the future. Here are some other examples of machine learning:

- Spam filtering
- Fraud detection
- Weather prediction
- Medical diagnosis
- Recommendation systems
- Image and speech recognition
- Predictive maintenance.
- Natural language processing
- Self-driving cars
- Environmental Monitoring

Now, let's understand a use case of day-to-day application of ML in solving everyday problems. The video below talks us through finding personal moments in videos and other applications of ML.
