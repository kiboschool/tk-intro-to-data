# Regression in ML
Imagine you are trying to predict the price of a house based on various features like the number of bedrooms, the area in square feet, and the age of the house. This problem **cannot** be solved with classification because the outcome you want to predict, i.e, the `house price`, is a continuous variable, meaning it can take ANY numerical value within a range. 

In contrast, classification is only used when the outcome is a categorical variable with distinct categories, like predicting whether an email is spam or not.

## Regression

**_Definition..._**

_Regression_ consists of models that predict a continuous outcome _(y)_ (dependent feature) based on the value of one or more predictor variables _(x)_ (independent features). The model is trained on a set of labeled data, which means that the data has been pre-classified into different categories.

However, unlike classification, the categories in regression are _continuous values_, such as height, weight, or price. Imagine you want to estimate how much time it will take for you to reach a friend's house based on the distance you have to travel and the average speed at which you drive.

In machine learning, regression works in a similar way. You show the computer many examples of distances traveled and the corresponding time taken to reach a destination. The computer then looks for patterns and relationships between the distances and the time.

Once the computer has learned from these examples, you can provide it with a new distance, and it will predict how much time it will take you to walk there based on what it learned. Hence, regression helps us make accurate predictions for numerical outcomes, just like estimating the time it will take for you to reach your friend's house based on the distance and your walking speed.


### Linear regression
Linear regression is a statistical technique used in machine learning to model the relationship between a dependent variable (the outcome we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (features or factors that influence the outcome). It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be approximated by a straight line.

Imagine you have a dataset that includes information about several houses, such as the size of the house (in square feet), the number of bedrooms, and the age of the house. You also have the corresponding prices at which each house was sold.

Linear regression works by finding a straight line (a mathematical equation) that best fits the relationship between the features (size, bedrooms, age) and the house prices. The goal is to find a line that minimizes the difference between the actual house prices and the predicted prices given by the line.

Here is a code snippet of a linear regression model that predict the price of house using a simulated data. Play around with the `new_house` values and see how the predicted house price changes.

In the code snippet, we used the `house_size`, `number_of_bedrooms`, and  `year_built` as the independent variable and `house_price` as the dependent variable. The model is trained on the data using `model.fit()`, and we use it to predict the price of a new house with a size of `1600` square feet, `3 bedrooms`, and built year of `2008`. The predicted_price will give us the estimated price for that new house based on the relationship learned from the training data.

**_Lesson summary..._**

**_Regression_** in ML is like teaching a computer to predict numbers. Imagine you have data on houses, including information like the number of bedrooms, the size of the house, and the location. You want the computer to estimate the price of a house based on these features.

Linear regression is commonly used for predicting numerical outcomes, such as predicting house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, and location. It is a simple yet powerful technique that forms the basis for more complex machine learning algorithms.
