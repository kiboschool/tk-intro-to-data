# Build your first ML model

In this lesson, we will take the first step into the realm of Machine Learning by building our very first predictive model. Imagine having the ability to predict house prices based on specific features of a house, such as its size, number of bedrooms, location, and more. This is exactly what we will achieve in this session â€“ **building a simple yet powerful Machine Learning model for house price prediction**.

Throughout this lesson, we will follow a step-by-step approach to understand the core concepts of Machine Learning that has been discussed so far. We'll be using a google colab for this practice exercise.
