# Getting to know ML
Machine learning is like teaching a computer how to learn from examples and make decisions on its own. Imagine you have a friend who loves to identifies pictures of different fruits. At first, you show your friend different pictures of red apples. Your friend learns from these examples and starts to recognize the differences between different red apples. Later, you show your friend new pictures of green apple, and they can tell you if it's still an apple based on what they learned from the previous examples. That's how _machine learning_ works!

**_Definition..._**

_Machine learning (ML)_ is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications or programs to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

For these ML algorithms, the more examples they see, the better they get at making accurate decisions without explicit programming, just like your friend learning to distinguish between different colours of apple. However, unlike humans who needs years of gathering experience in a particular task, such as image recognition, ML learns to do this in just a matter of _hours_ using quality data.

## Categories of ML
In ML, the type of data we have and the problem we plan to solve largely determines the type of ML to use. Watch this video from IBM on different categories of ML.

At the high level, we have 3 broad categories of ML.
- Supervised learning
- Unupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

**_Chapter Summary..._**

<!-- **_Machine learning_** is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications or programs to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

It like having a smart assistant that learns and improves over time by observing and analyzing data, making it a powerful tool for solving complex problems and making accurate predictions in various fields, from recognizing images to predicting stock prices. -->

### üë©üèæ‚Äçüé® Practice: Categories of machine learning... üéØ

There are 3 problem set provided below. Based on your understanding of ML and its categories, classify each of the problem set into one of `supervised`, `unsupervised`, and `reinforcement` learning.

1. You're given a dataset of patient medical records, including symptoms, test results, and final diagnoses. Your task is to develop an ML model to predict whether a patient has a certain medical condition based on their symptoms and test results. What type of ML problem is this?

2. Imagine you're building an autonomous car that needs to navigate through a simulated city. The car learns to drive safely and efficiently by receiving rewards for following traffic rules and penalties for collisions. What suitable ML problem type is this?

3. You have a dataset of patient medical records, including symptoms, test results, and final diagnoses. Your task is to develop an ML model to predict whether a patient has a certain medical condition based on their symptoms and test results. What suitable ML problem type is this?
