![covid-19](./intro-to-data/covid_19.png)

#### Dataset Description:
You have been provided with a **[COVID-19 dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1skQFAP9whhf9di2ncRxwZalgLPGF6Lrqxa8Jfi0njXQ/edit?usp=sharing)** containing the following columns:
- **Country**: Name of the country.
- **Total Cases**: Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **New Cases**: Number of new COVID-19 cases reported.
- **Total Deaths**: Total number of COVID-19 related deaths.
- **New Deaths**: Number of new COVID-19 related deaths reported.
- **Total Recovered**: Total number of COVID-19 recoveries.
- **New Recovered**: Number of new COVID-19 recoveries reported.
- **Active Cases**: Number of active COVID-19 cases.
- **Serious, Critical**: Number of critical COVID-19 cases.
- **Tot Cases/1M pop**: Total cases per 1 million population.
- **Deaths/1M pop**: Deaths per 1 million population.
- **Total Tests**: Total number of COVID-19 tests conducted.
- **Tests/1M pop**: Tests per 1 million population.
- **Population**: Total population of the country.

#### Assignment Objective:
Your task is to clean the dataset and create visualizations to explore the global COVID-19 situation, focusing on the distribution of cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries.

#### Assignment Tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identify and handle missing or erroneous data by checking for any blank cells or "N/A" entries in the dataset.
      - Select the range of cells you want to check.
      - Go to the "Format" menu, choose "Conditional formatting".
      - Set up a rule to format cells with blank values or `N/A` text differently (e.g., highlight them in red).
      - Replace any missing or erroneous values with appropriate data (e.g., mean or median values).
   - Ensure consistent formatting:
     - Convert any text values to numbers if necessary.
     - Remove any extra spaces or special characters from the data.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to explore the distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries.
    - Choose the columns containing COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries data, as well as the corresponding countries.
    - Use appropriate chart types such as bar charts, pie charts, or choropleth maps to visualize the data.
      - For comparing values across countries, consider using a bar chart or a column chart.
      - If you want to show the proportion of cases, deaths, and recoveries for each country, a pie chart could be suitable.
      - To visualize geographic distribution, use a choropleth map where countries are shaded based on the intensity of COVID-19 metrics.
      Create Your Chart:
      - Select the data range.
      - Go to the "Insert" menu and choose the chart type you want to use.
      - Customize your chart by adding titles, axis labels, and legends to provide context.
