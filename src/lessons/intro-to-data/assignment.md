## Data Cleaning and Visualization with a COVID-19 Dataset

#### Dataset Description:
You have been provided with a **[COVID-19 dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1skQFAP9whhf9di2ncRxwZalgLPGF6Lrqxa8Jfi0njXQ/edit?usp=sharing)** containing the following columns:
- **Country**: Name of the country.
- **Total Cases**: Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **New Cases**: Number of new COVID-19 cases reported.
- **Total Deaths**: Total number of COVID-19 related deaths.
- **New Deaths**: Number of new COVID-19 related deaths reported.
- **Total Recovered**: Total number of COVID-19 recoveries.
- **New Recovered**: Number of new COVID-19 recoveries reported.
- **Active Cases**: Number of active COVID-19 cases.
- **Serious, Critical**: Number of critical COVID-19 cases.
- **Tot Cases/1M pop**: Total cases per 1 million population.
- **Deaths/1M pop**: Deaths per 1 million population.
- **Total Tests**: Total number of COVID-19 tests conducted.
- **Tests/1M pop**: Tests per 1 million population.
- **Population**: Total population of the country.

#### Assignment Objective:
Your task is to clean the dataset and create visualizations to explore the global COVID-19 situation, focusing on the distribution of cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries.

#### Assignment Tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identify and handle missing or erroneous data:
     - Check for any blank cells or "N/A" entries in the dataset.
     - Replace any missing or erroneous values with appropriate data (e.g., mean or median values).
   - Ensure consistent formatting:
     - Convert any text values to numbers if necessary.
     - Remove any extra spaces or special characters from the data.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to explore the distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries.
   - Use appropriate chart types such as bar charts, pie charts, or choropleth maps to visualize the data.
   - Add titles, labels, and legends to the visualizations to provide context and clarity.

#### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your assignment as a Google Sheets document using **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZDkMXq0IrsyS4L8Y7ayfyVFTkn7HCDdykQV7bTj_wMC4-AQ/viewform)**.
- Include some explanations and comments for each step of the data cleaning process and for each visualization in a new worksheet.
