Data is increasing rapidly due to several factors... 
- rise of digital technologies 
- growing use of the internet and social media 
- increasing number of devices and sensors that generate data. 

In fact, it is estimated that the amount of data generated worldwide will reach 180 zettabytes by 2025, up from just 4.4 zettabytes in 2013. This explosion of data presents both opportunities and challenges for data scientists, who must find ways to extract insights and value from this vast and complex data landscape.
