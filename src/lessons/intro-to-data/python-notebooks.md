# Python and Jupyter Notebooks
As previous stated, data scientist use different combination of tools on a daily basis to capture, organize, manipulate, analyze, visualize,a and communicate their findings. In this section, we'll start by looking at the most popular programming language for data science - `Python`. Next, we'll explore `Jupyter Notebook` - an interactive web-based platform.

## Basic intro to Python
Just the same way we use natural languages like swahili, english, french, arabic, and spanish to communicate, we also need to communicate with computers using some predefined languages known as `programming languages` so that our instruction can be executed. In this course, we'll be learning Python as a programming language for data analysis. Before jumping into the syntax (rules) and semantics of Python, let first understand why the buzz around this programming language.

**_Python: Getting started..._**

Now that you understand why Python is so popular, let get started by exploring some basic syntax (i.e. rules) and building blocks of the language. You'll use the interactive python shell below to learn about:
- `The shell`
- `Variables`
- `For Loops`
- `If statements`, and
- `List`

To get started, read the instructions on the left and write the codes in the shell (the black console)

Once you complete the lesson on `List`, then you should by now have a basic understanding of how python works. The question you might want to ask now is _How can i work with data using Python?_. To answer that, let's take a step back and identify what is missing.

> **❓ How can i work with data using Python?**

Previously, we've seen how it is possible to capture and manipulate data using Google Sheets. However, you're limited to only the features provided by Google sheets, even though there is more you can do as a data scientist. This is why you need python to programatically do everything you have in Google sheet and more. To do that, we'll be using Jupter Notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a free and open standard software for interactive computing across all programming languages. It allows you create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. For this course, we'll be using an **__online version__** of jupyter notebook known as `Google Colab!`, to avoid the need for installation and configuration for jupyter notebook.

📺 **_What is Google Colab?_**

A cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that provides a range of features for data science work.

With `Colab`, you can do everything you've done using the python shell and more. To wrap up, let look at the benefit of Colab for a data scientist.
- **Free Resources**:Provision of free cloud computing resources.
- **Collaboration**: allows multiple users to work on the same notebook simultaneously
- **Integration with Google Drive**: Colab integrates with Google Drive, allowing users to easily access and store data files and notebooks.
- **Pre-installed libraries**: comes with many pre-installed libraries and frameworks commonly used in data science, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
- **Code execution**: allows users to execute code in real-time and see the results immediately.
- **Visualization**: provides support for data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

In summary, Google Colab is a powerful tool for data scientists, providing access to powerful computing resources, collaboration tools, and a range of features for data analysis and machine learning.
