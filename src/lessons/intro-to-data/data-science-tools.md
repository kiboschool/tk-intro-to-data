As a multidisciplinary field, data science uses myriads of tools for different tasks within the phases of the data science workflow, and we'll explore some of these tools in this course. To start with, let understand what are _spreadsheets_ and why do we need them as data scientist. 

### What are spreadsheets?
**Spreadsheets** are softwares that allows a user to capture, organize, and manipulate data represeted in `rows` and `columns`. They are often designed to hold **numeric** and **short text** data types. Today, there are many spreadsheet programs out there which can be used locally on your PC or online through your browsers.
