# üî¢ Data and Spreadsheets
As a multidisciplinary field, data science uses myriads of tools for different tasks within the phases of the data science workflow, and we'll explore some of these tools in this course. In this section, we'll start by looking at spreadsheets, and further explore a popular spreadsheet software - _Google Sheets_. To start with, let understand what we mean by _spreadsheets_ and why we need them as data scientist. 

## What are spreadsheets?
**Spreadsheets** are softwares that allows a user to capture, organize, and manipulate data represeted in `rows` and `columns`. They are often designed to hold **numeric** and **short text** data types. Today, there are many spreadsheet programs out there which can be used locally on your PC or online through your browsers. They provide different features to ease data manipulation as shown below.

### Benefits of spreadsheets
- **Ease of use** - Spreadsheets are widely used and familiar to many people, making them easy to use.
- **Data organization** - Spreadsheets provide a structured way to organize data, making it easier to sort, filter, and analyze datasets.
- **Data analysis** - Spreadsheets provide a range of functions and formulas that allow for basic data analysis, such as summing, averaging, and finding min/max values.
- **Collaboration** - Spreadsheets can be easily shared and edited by multiple users, making them a useful tool for collaboration and teamwork.
- **Cost-effective** - Many spreadsheet programs are available for free or at a low cost, making them an affordable option for data analysis.

Overall, spreadsheets are a useful tool for data science tasks, particularly for tasks that involve organizing, manipulating, and analyzing data on a smaller scale. However, for more complex data analysis tasks or larger datasets, specialized software tools and/or programming languages may be required.

#### How can i use spreadsheet?
Popular spreadsheet softwares currently available includes Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Smartsheet, and Zoho Sheet among others. However, Microsoft Excel is the most popular within the data science communities. For ease of use and access, let explore an _**online version**_ of Microsoft Excel known as `Google Sheet`.

**_Google Sheet..._**

Google sheet allows you to create, organize, and manipulate your data in rows and columns while collaborating with others. It is one of the most popular spreadsheet software currently in the market.

To have a general background on how google sheet works and the features therein 
- Watch the next video üì∫. 
- Pause and practice along with the tutor.
- At the end, create a new sheet and start all over again without watching the video.

#### **A brief recap of Google Sheets...**
- Google sheet is an online spreadsheet program create by `Google`.
- To create a new sheet, you must have an active google account.
    - Type `sheet.new` in your browser and hit _Enter_.
- Enter your data in rows and columns across the worksheet.
- Google sheet automatically save your work. Hence, you **don't** loose your data!
- There are predefined `built-in` functions to help you with basic and complex arithmetics. Some basic ones are;
    - **AVG** - finds the average of a range of cells
    - **SUM** - adds up a range of cells
    - **MIN** - finds the minimum of a range of cells
    - **MAX** - finds the maximum of a range of cells
    - **COUNT** - counts the values in a range of cells

Next, we'll explore a sample dataset using Google Sheets. As we've learnt in the previous video, you can have more than one `worksheet` in a google sheet. In this sample dataset, we have 3 worksheets with different dataset...
- **corona_virus** - official daily counts of COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccine utilisation.
- **movies** - contains information about movies, including their names, release dates, user ratings, genres, overviews, and others.
- **emissions** - contains information about methane gas emissions globally.

### üë©üèæ‚Äçüé® Practice: Data playground... üéØ

Look through the data in each worksheet to have a sense of what the dataset represent and attempt the following.
- Which country üè≥Ô∏è has the highest number of `active` COVID-19 cases?
- Which movie üéûÔ∏è has the `lowest` budget?
- What is the total üåÖ `emmisions` globally?
- Try to change the üî¥ colour of each workbook.

**Note:** Remember to use the built-in functions.
