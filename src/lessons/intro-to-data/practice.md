## Data Cleaning and Visualization Using Google Sheets

### Dataset Description:
You have been provided with a **[dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U0bElpR3UMnuqtd3RgdbqVX2VkgRGtlV/view?usp=sharing)** containing the following columns:
- **Country**: Name of the country.
- **Income per Person**: Average income per person in the country.
- **Internet Use Rate**: Percentage of the population using the internet.
- **Urban Rate**: Percentage of the population living in urban areas.

#### Objective:
Your task is to **clean** the dataset and **create visualizations** to explore the relationships between _income_, _internet use_, and _urbanization_ across different _countries_.

#### Steps to Complete the Exercise:
1. **Load the Dataset into Google Sheets**:
   - Open Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet.
   - Copy and paste the dataset into the spreadsheet or use the `IMPORTDATA` function to import data from a CSV file.

2. **Data Cleaning and Formatting**:
   - Identify and handle missing or erroneous data:
     - Check for any blank cells or `N/A` entries in the dataset.
     - Replace any missing or erroneous values with appropriate data (e.g., average income per person for missing values).
   - Ensure consistent formatting:
     - Convert any text values to numbers if necessary.
     - Remove any extra spaces or special characters from the data.
   - Rename column headers to be more descriptive if needed.

3. **Create Basic Visualizations**:
   - Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between _income per person_ and _internet use rate_.
   - Create a bar chart or pie chart to compare _internet use rates_ across different countries.
   - Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of _urbanization rates_ among the countries.

4. **Enhance Visualizations**:
   - Add appropriate titles and labels to each chart to provide context and clarity.
   - Customize the appearance of the charts by adjusting colors, fonts, and styles to improve readability.

5. **Submission**:
   - Write a brief summary of your findings based on the visualizations in the same google sheet document by creating a new worksheet.
   - Submit the URL to your Google Sheets using **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiRMuyhHe9gqLhzvE_mnCyWhWM9XUreXDIJwdF2gOlrvIDQw/viewform)**.
