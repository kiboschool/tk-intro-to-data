# üî¢ Data and Spreadsheets
As a multidisciplinary field, data science uses myriads of tools for different tasks within the phases of the data science workflow, and we'll explore some of these tools in this course. In this section, we'll start by looking at spreadsheets, and further explore a popular web-based spreadsheet software - _Google Sheet_. To start with, let us understand what we mean by _spreadsheets_ and why we need them as data scientist. 

### What are Spreadsheets?

<aside>

**_Definition..._**

**Spreadsheets** are softwares that allows a user to capture, organize, and manipulate data represeted in `rows` and `columns`.
</aside>

 They are often designed to hold **numeric** and **short text** data types. Today, there are many spreadsheet programs out there which can be used locally on your PC or online through your browsers. They provide different features to ease data manipulation as shown below.

**Benefits of spreadsheets**
- **Ease of use** -sSpreadsheets are widely used and familiar to many people, making them easy to use.
- **Data organization** - it provide a structured way to organize data, making it easier to sort, filter, and analyze datasets.
- **Data analysis** - it also provides a range of functions and formulas that allow for basic data analysis, such as summing, averaging, and finding min/max values.
- **Collaboration** - Spreadsheets can be easily shared and edited by multiple users, making them a useful tool for collaboration and teamwork.
- **Cost-effective** - Many spreadsheet programs are available for free or at a low cost, making them an affordable option for data analysis.

Overall, spreadsheets are a useful tool for data science tasks, particularly for tasks that involve organizing, manipulating, and analyzing data on a smaller scale. However, for more complex data analysis tasks or larger datasets, specialized software tools and/or programming languages may be required.

#### How can i use spreadsheet?
Popular spreadsheet softwares currently available includes Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Smartsheet, and Zoho Sheet among others. However, Microsoft Excel is the most popular within the data science communities. To get started quickly without any installation bottleneck, we'll be using _`Google Sheet`_ - a web-based spreadsheet.

**_Google Sheet..._**

Google Sheet allows you to create, organize, and manipulate your data in rows and columns while collaborating with others. It is one of the most popular web-based spreadsheet software currently in the market.

To have a general background on how Google Sheet works and the features therein 
- Watch the next video üì∫. 
- Pause and practice along with the instructor.

**A brief recap on how to use Google Sheet...**
- Google Sheet is a free web-based spreadsheet program create by _Google_.
- By default, you can create and manage google sheet using your google account (i.e., your Kibo email).
- **Access Google Sheets**: Use Google apps icon or Google Drive to launch Sheets.
    - Alrternatively, just type `sheets.new` in your browser and hit _Enter_
- **Creating and organizing sheets**: Name sheets, choose file location, add multiple sheets, and organize with folders.
- **Importing data**: Upload files from devices, choose import options, and convert Excel files for compatibility.
- **Using cells, columns, and rows**: Navigate and select cells, input data, and understand cell naming conventions.
- **Formulas and charts**: Create formulas for calculations, customize headers, and insert and customize charts.

Next, we'll explore a sample dataset using Google Sheet. As we've learnt in the previous video, you can have more than one `worksheet` in a workbook. In this sample dataset, we have 3 worksheets with different dataset. 
- **corona_virus** - official daily counts of COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccine utilisation.
- **movies** - information about movies, including their names, release dates, user ratings, genres, overviews, and others.
- **emissions** - information about methane gas emissions globally.

1. Create a copy of this **[dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1skQFAP9whhf9di2ncRxwZalgLPGF6Lrqxa8Jfi0njXQ/edit?usp=sharing)** for your own use. 
2. Explore each worksheet to have a sense of what the data represent.
3. Attempt the following questions.
    - Which country üè≥Ô∏è has the highest number of `active` COVID-19 cases?
    - Which movie üéûÔ∏è has the `lowest` budget?
    - What is the total `emmisions` üåÖ globally?
    - Try to change the üî¥ colour of each workbook.

**Note:** Remember to use the built-in functions where neccessary.
