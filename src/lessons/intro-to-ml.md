**Welcome to week 4 of the Intro to data science course!** In the third week, we looked at data visualization using Looker studio. We went further to understand different ways we can create _charts_ and dashboards to report insight effectively. 

This week, we'll begin our journey of machine learning üòç by looking at what it is, and why it is so important for individual and businesses. Next, we'll look at different machine learning techniques - `supervised` and `unsupervised` learning. Also, we'll learn about classification and regresion, and finally explore some practical applications of machine learning üòç.


## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Explain the basics and importance of machine learning in today's world.
