# Creating dashboards
Creating dashboards in Looker is like building a control panel for your data — it gives you a clear, organized view of important information all in one place. Imagine you're driving a car and your dashboard shows you everything you need to know about your journey — like speed, fuel level, and navigation. 

In the same way, Looker dashboards display key metrics and insights from your data, helping you make informed decisions and steer a business in the right direction through their data. To create a dashboard, Charts are an important component we can piece together to tell different stories and reveal valuable insights about a data.
