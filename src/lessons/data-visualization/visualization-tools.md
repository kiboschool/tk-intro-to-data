# Visualization Tools and Libraries
From decsion making to performance monitoring and customer insights, data visualization plays a crucial role in businesses across various industries. By leveraging data visualizations, we can unlock the value of data, gain insights, and drive success in a competitive market landscape. However, to achieve these, we need to choose the right tools or libraries to do the job. 

## Visualisation tools
Visualization tools and libraries play a vital role in data science by enabling data scientists to visually explore, analyze, and communicate insights from data. These tools offer various options for customization, interactivity, and data manipulation, allowing users to create interactive visualizations, apply statistical analysis, and combine multiple data sources. They often support different types of visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, network graphs, and geographic maps, among others. 

Similarly, they can be standalone applications or integrated into programming languages like Python and R through dedicated libraries. In this section, we'll explore 4 visualization or business intelligence tools.
