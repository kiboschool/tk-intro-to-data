# Visualization Tools and Libraries
From decsion making to performance monitoring and customer insights, data visualization plays a crucial role in businesses across various industries. By leveraging data visualizations, we can unlock the value of data, gain insights, and drive success in a competitive market landscape. However, to achieve these, we need to choose the right tools or libraries to do the job. 

## Visualisation tools
Visualization tools and libraries play a vital role in data science by enabling data scientists to visually explore, analyze, and communicate insights from data. These tools offer various options for customization, interactivity, and data manipulation, allowing users to create interactive visualizations, apply statistical analysis, and combine multiple data sources. They often support different types of visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, network graphs, and geographic maps, among others. 

Similarly, they can be standalone applications or integrated into programming languages like Python and R through dedicated libraries. In this section, we'll explore 4 visualization tools - `Power BI`, `Tableau`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.

### Power BI

In summary...
- Seaborn is a library for data visualization that offers more functionality than Matplotlib.
- Seaborn has built-in datasets, such as the penguins dataset, which contains information about penguins' characteristics.
- One-variable plots in Seaborn can be created for continuous values using histogram-like plots called "displots."
- Categorical columns can be visualized using Seaborn's `countplot` to display the count of each category.
- Seaborn's `displot` can also be used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable by different categories using the "hue" parameter. Additionally, the plot can be smoothed using the "kde" parameter.

<!-- In this lesson, we've seen how to read data from CSV and API, and how to get a view of our data using `head()` function. Now you need to explore other Pandas functions.
1. Using the DataFrame you loaded from the CSV, what type of information do you get when you use `describe()` and `tail()` function?
2. Share your answer using the padlet below.
