# Exploring Looker Studio

## Data Connectors
Imagine you have different storage places for your data, like a big library with lots of books. Now, think of data connectors as special tools that help you easily find and bring those books from different shelves in the library to your desk, so you can read and analyze them. 

In Looker Studio, these connectors work like magical bridges between your data sources (like databases, spreadsheets, or cloud services) and Looker, making it simple for you to access and explore your data without having to do any heavy lifting.

### Data Cleaning in Looker

Just like sorting through your clothes to remove any wrinkles or stains, data cleaning in Looker involves identifying and fixing any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in your data. This ensures that when you analyze your data, you can trust the results and make informed decisions based on accurate information.

Conseuently, data cleaning in Looker is essential because it helps make our data more reliable and easier to work with, ultimately leading to better insights and smarter decision-making. It's like giving your data a makeover, so it's polished and presentable for analysis ü•∞.

To summarise data cleaning functionalities in Looker studio, remember to note the following points:
- **Identifying missing values**
    - Look for `no data`, `zeros`, or `unknowns` in reports as they can skew analysis.
- **Handling missing values**: 
    - It's crucial to decide whether to remove or keep them, considering the proportion relative to the dataset.
    - Utilize filters or controls to remove null values, but be cautious as it may affect other data.
    - Options like _showing no data_ or _replacing with zeros_ are also methods of dealing with missing values, ensuring clarity in visualization.
- **Data types**
    - Incorrect data types, such as treating numeric values as text, can lead to wrong conclusions; ensure proper data type assignment for accurate analysis.

<!-- ### 2. Removing duplicates

Just like removing duplicates entries in your phone contacts, removing duplicates using Looker ensures that each record is unique by streamlining and simplifying the dataset to eliminate redundant information.
