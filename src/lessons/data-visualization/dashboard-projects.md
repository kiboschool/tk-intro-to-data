# Practice - Dashboard Projects
In this practice exercise, you'll dive into the exciting world of dashboard creation, focusing on two essential projects: a _Logistic_ report and _Site Traffic_ Dashboard. These projects will give you hands-on experience in analyzing data and visualizing key metrics to drive informed decision-making within organizations.

Let's get started by exploring each dashboard project in detail and learning how to build them from scratch using the powerful tools available in Looker. Here's a step-by-step guide to attempt this practice exercise.


### Step-by-Step Instructions:

- Start by watching the video. Pay close attention to each step demonstrated by the instructor.
- Open **Looker** and ensure that you have access to the sample dataset provided for the dashboard project.
    - Check the video description for the dataset.
- Begin by importing the sample dataset into your workspace. 
- Follow along with the instructor as they demonstrate how to create each visualization component of the dashboard.
