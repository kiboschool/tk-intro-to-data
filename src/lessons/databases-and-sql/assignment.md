### Instructions
For this assignment, you are expected to use the SQL editor below to write and run your SQL queries.

1. **Data Setup:**

   - Create a table `transactions`.
   - Insert the dataset into the transactions table by using **[this script](https://onecompiler.com/mysql/429k6yn35)**

2. **SQL Queries:**

    Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks:
   - Retrieve the first 10 records from the dataset using the `SELECT` and `LIMIT` command.
   - Calculate the total number of transactions in the dataset using the `SELECT` and `COUNT()` fuction.
   - Find the total revenue generated from online sales using the `SUM()` function.
   - Identify the top 5 best-selling products by quantity sold using the `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` command.
   - Calculate the average unit price of products sold ysing the `AVG()`.
   - Determine the total sales revenue generated by each country.
   - Find the total quantity of products purchased by each customer.
   - Identify the most common payment method used for transactions.

3. **Data Management:**

   - Create a new table named `customer_info` with columns for customer details such as '*Customer_ID*', '*Customer_Name*', and '_Email_'.
      - Use the `CREATE TABLE` command for this.
   - Insert sample customer data into the newly created table.
      - Use the `INSERT INTO` command for this.
   - Update the dataset to include a new column 'Discount' and calculate a `10%` discount for each transaction.
      - Use the `UPDATE` command for this.
   - Delete transactions with a quantity of `0` or _negative_ values.
      - Use the `DELETE` command for this.

4. **Joining Tables:**

   - Perform inner joins between the original dataset and the 'Customer_Info' table based on the 'Customer_ID' column.
   - Write a query to retrieve transaction details along with corresponding customer information.

5. **SQL Functions:**

   - Utilize SQL functions to...
     - Calculate the total price for each transaction (Unit_Price * Quantity).
     - Extract the month and year from the '`Transaction_Date`' column.
     - Concatenate the '`Product_Name`' and '`Country`' columns to create a new column 'Product_Location'.
