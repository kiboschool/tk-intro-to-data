# Final project

---

**Due Date: TBD**

<aside>

ðŸ‘¥ **This is a team project**. You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with
before, or find new teammates. Communicate with your teammates, then schedule time to work on the project.

A list of project ideas will be made available (includong dataset), and each team will chose which project they want to work on. It is allowed if your team choose to work on a project outside the samples provided.

<!-- You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new project in
Replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should be sure that
both of your names are linked to the submission in Github and Gradescope. -->

# Description

Your final project will involve cleaning, analyzing, and drawing insight from a data to solve a real-life problem. Remember you're doing this with your team.

Youâ€™ve learned a ton about data collection and cleaning, visualization, and insight in this course. The final project is your chance to solve a problem with these from scratch.

## Project and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide the project for your final project. The challenge is to
choose a project that is exciting to you, but is not so big that itâ€™s
overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Hereâ€™s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project youâ€™ll be
able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated
  exercises and projects youâ€™ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Donâ€™t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use
  mostly what youâ€™ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the
  things you run into along the way).

<!-- ### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We havenâ€™t covered how to collect and save data from users. Donâ€™t plan to build
a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site. -->

## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using [Google docs](https://docs.google.com) or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.
