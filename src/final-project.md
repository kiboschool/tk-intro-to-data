**Due Date: 07/06/2024**

<aside>

ðŸ‘¥ **This is a team project**. You can work with teammates youâ€™ve worked with
before, or find new teammates. Communicate with your teammates, then schedule time to work on the project.

**Please note:**
- A list of sample project ideas has been provided (including links to useful dataset), and each team will choose which project they want to work on. 
- It is allowed if your team choose to work on a project outside the samples provided.

## Description

Youâ€™ve learned a ton about data, data cleaning, and visualization in this course. The final project is your chance to solve a problem with these from scratch. Your final project will involve cleaning, analyzing, and drawing insight from a dataset using visuals to solve a real-life problem. Remember, you're doing this with your team.


## Project and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide which of the provided projects are you choosing for the final project. The challenge is to
choose a project that is exciting to you, but is not so big that itâ€™s
overwhelming or impossible to complete. 

Hereâ€™s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project youâ€™ll be
able to complete.

- Form a team with **maximum** of 3 members.
- Choose from the list of sample projects provided below to work on.
- It is allowed if your team choose to work on a project outside the samples provided.
- Donâ€™t plan to learn a whole new tool/technology for the final project. Plan to use
  mostly what youâ€™ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the
  things you run into along the way).
- You're expected to use Looker studio for your visualizations.
- Add a little bit of documentation to show the steps you took during the implementation of your project.


## Sample Projects and Dataset
Here are sample projects you can choose from for your final projects. Remember, the sample projects are optional, hence, your team can decide to work on projects outside the samples provided below.

### Dataset Guideline
- Click on the dataset link of your preferred project, this should open up a list of possible dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a data science platform. You'll need to create an account if you don't have one.
- Explore each dataset by clicking on it and getting to know what the dataset is about.
  - Only choose a dataset that that is useful for your team's project
- Download the dataset using the download button at the top-right part of the dataset page.
- Clean the dataset - most public dataset requires you clean them.
- Import your dataset into Looker studio and start with your analysis

<!-- ### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We havenâ€™t covered how to collect and save data from users. Donâ€™t plan to build
a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site. -->

## How should you work together?

Youâ€™ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isnâ€™t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how youâ€™ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when youâ€™ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using **[Google docs](https://docs.google.com)** or a text file in **[Replit](https://replit.com)**, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work youâ€™ve done, and what work is left to do.

## Submission
  - Submit a link to your completed project **[here]()**.
    - Remember to set the access to your Looker project to public under `Sharing`.
  - Submission is **individual**. Therefore, each team member MUST submit a copy of their project.
